## How to create new stories

Stories are stored in the `./stories` folder

Each group of story should be place in one or many `.stories.[tsx|jsx]` file

The default exported object, configure the stories.

```javascript
export default {
    title: '@ferlab/ui/layout/ScrollView',
    component: ScrollView,
    argTypes: {
        orientation: {
            controler: {
                type: 'select',
                options: ['Horizontal', 'Vertical'],
            },
        },
    },
};
```

#### Title

The title will create the tree structure to display the stories.

e.g. it we have three files with the following title:

> '@ferlab/ui/layout/ScrollView', '@ferlab/ui/layout/StackLayout', '@ferlab/ui/components/Label'

```
@ferlab
 |- ui
    |- components
    |   |- Label
